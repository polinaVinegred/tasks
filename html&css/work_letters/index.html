    	<p>On this page you can see my attempts to become a layout designer.<br />
    	I think I'm not doing well.<br /> 
 		But not so bad!<br /> 
 		The goal of this activity is to practice writing texts and creating a simple page.</p>
    	<h2 class="subtitle">is this also a title?</h2>
   		<p>In fact, this text does not make the slightest sense, like this entire site.<br /> 
    	I'm doing this now to train my skills, that's all...</p>
