		<p>
			Don't let your soul get lazy!<br />
			So that the water does not crush in the mortar,<br />
			The soul <em>must work</em><br />
			Day and night, and day and night!<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Drive her from house to house<br />
			Drag from stage to stage<br />
			Through the wasteland, through the windbreak<br />
			Through a snowdrift, through a bump!<br />
		</p>
		<p>
			Don't let her sleep in bed<br />
			By the light of the morning star<br />
			Keep a lazy woman in a black body<br />
			And do not remove the knots from it!<br />
		</p>
